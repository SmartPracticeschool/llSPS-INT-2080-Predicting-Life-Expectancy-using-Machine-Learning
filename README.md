<h2>Predicting Life Expectancy using Machine Learning</h2>

Life expectancy is a statistical measure of the average time a human being is expected to live, Life expectancy depends on various factors: Regional variations, Economic Circumstances, Sex Differences, Mental Illnesses, Physical Illnesses, Education, Year of their birth and other demographic factors.  

The project relies on the accuracy of the data. The Global Health Observatory (GHO) data repository under the World Health Organization (WHO) keeps track of the health status as well as many other related factors for all countries. The datasets are made available to the public for the purpose of health data analysis. The data-set related to life expectancy, health factors for 193 countries have been collected from the same WHO data repository website and its corresponding economic data was collected from the United Nations website. Among all categories of health-related factors, only those critical factors were chosen which are more representative.

This problem statement provides a way to predict the average life expectancy of people living in a country when various factors such as year, GDP, education, alcohol intake of people in the country, expenditure on the healthcare system, and some specific disease-related deaths that happened in the country are given.
